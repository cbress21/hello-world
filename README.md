First repository

I first started coding when I was 13 years old - HTML. When I entered high-school I became enamored with girls and booze. I lost interest in old hobbies and personal growth. This only got worse over the years. I turned into an alcoholic/addict. Rather than pursuing my dreams and talent, I sought, what I had thought was, a good time. Finally, at the ripe age of 32, I asked for help. I entered a drug and alcohol rehab facility. That was the best decision I have ever made. After 5 months of sobriety, I have rediscovered my passion and drive to build and improve. This is my first step into the world of coding.
